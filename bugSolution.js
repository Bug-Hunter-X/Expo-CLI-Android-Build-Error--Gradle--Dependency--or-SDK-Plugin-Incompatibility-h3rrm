The solution involves several steps to identify and resolve the root cause.  First, carefully check the complete error message from the Expo CLI build process to identify the specific issue. If it's a Gradle error, update the Gradle version to a compatible one by modifying the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file. If it's related to dependencies, review your `package.json` file and check if you're using the correct version of Expo and any related libraries. If the error indicates an incompatibility between the Expo SDK and Gradle Plugin versions, consult the Expo documentation for the latest compatible versions and update accordingly.  You might need to clean and rebuild the project using `expo prebuild` and `expo run:android` after making any changes.  In some cases, completely deleting the `android/` directory and running `expo prebuild` might be necessary to refresh the project.  Always refer to the Expo documentation and any relevant Stack Overflow discussions for the latest troubleshooting steps.  Remember to check for updated versions of the Expo and associated libraries to ensure compatibility.
