This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves an issue with the Android build process.  The exact error message might vary, but it often relates to problems with Gradle, the Android build system, or missing dependencies.  It can manifest as build failures, crashes, or unexpected behavior during the build process.  One common cause is an incompatibility between the Expo SDK version and the Android Gradle Plugin version. Another cause is missing or corrupted dependencies in the project's `android/` directory.
